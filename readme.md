## Idea

The idea is to create a set of components in various programming languages, which however works almost the same way. This way it will be easier for developers to go around and play with another programming language without having to find a whole new set of components and dig into how it works.    
Current programming languages: [php](https://github.com/fistlab/php)

## Components

* [Container](https://github.com/fistphp/container)
